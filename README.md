practicing the tutorial
Hard-working, previous retail management career ended. Now relaunching into software engineering &/or website development. I enjoy content writing, creative flow, and the theory behind creating an interactive web experience through javascript. Implementing those new skill sets into a useful porfolio is my ultimate summer goal. Let's make it happen!
